    "\n",
    "You will learn about Paillier encryption.  First you will demonstrate the homomorphic and obfuscation properties of the Paillier algorithm.  Then you will execute two different types of anonymous elections using Paillier encryption.  You will then learn the math behind the algorithm.  Finally, 3 sample applications using Paillier encryption are given to demonstrate the capabilities of partial homomorphic encryption.\n",

    "This lab is authored by Dr. Joseph Gersch, adapted and inspired by several sources including Professor Bill Buchanan's [web site on Paillier encryption](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/pal_ex).  I highly encourage you to browse [asecuritysite.com](asecuritysite.com) site because it has so many items to experiment with.  I have also sourced information from the wikipedia page on Paillier encryption and a [master's thesis on Paillier voting](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/73a6/503dc37faacc96734f551719aec3392e8dc4.pdf).\n",

    "## General Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Paillier encrytion is a public-key algorithm that uses large prime numbers to generate a private and public keypair.  The public key is used to encrypt the data. The private key is used to decrypt the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other public-key algorithms such as RSA, eliptic-curve and ElGamel encryption, the Paillier encryption algorithm is partially homomorphic. This allows a person to do arithmetic on sensitive data without actually being able to view the data.\n",
    "The results will remain encrypted and can only be viewed by someone who can decrypt the ciphertext using the private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paillier encryption has another property in that it can encrypt plaintext numbers into multiple different ciphertext values based on a random number.  All values will be decrypted back to the original unique plaintext value.  This will be demonstrated below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='homomorphic_properties'></a>\n",
    "### Homomorphic Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Pallier encrytion has additive homomorphism but not multiplicative homomorphism.  Its properties are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encrypted numbers can be added together.\n",
    "* Encrypted numbers can be multiplied by a non encrypted scalar.\n",
    "* Encrypted numbers can be added to non encrypted scalars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try experimenting with these properties. We will use the python-paillier library.  The main web page for the library is located [here](https://python-paillier.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html).  The API documentation is located [here](https://python-paillier.readthedocs.io/en/develop/phe.html#module-phe.paillier).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start out with simple encryption and decryption.  Execute the cell below."

    "[master's thesis on Paillier voting](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/73a6/503dc37faacc96734f551719aec3392e8dc4.pdf).  Assume there are at most 99 voters.  We use the candidate numbers to create a \"voter message\" using the equation `100**candidate_number`.  If there were 1000 voters we would simply change the base to 1000.  This allows us to create a single number accounting for each candidate as illustrated in the demo code below.  The voter message is then encrypted and the paillier sum is performed.  The tally is then determined by splitting out the final result into 2 digits for each candidate.\n",
