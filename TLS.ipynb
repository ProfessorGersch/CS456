    "\n",
    "You will learn how to deploy a web server that uses HTTPS over a secure encrypted TCP connection.  In order to do this you will create TLS self-signed certificates and use these certificate in a simple web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the python libraries and command dependencies to successfully run this lab should already be installed and available on the CS lab machines.  This jupyter notebook can be run on a CS lab machine and you can use SSH tunnels to view the notebook on your local laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "I encourage you download and run this lab on your own personal computer.  You may have to install the FLASK web server (`pip install flask`) if you don't already have it.  You will also have to download the `openssl` command for your particular OS.  Examples are `brew install openssl` for MAC, and `apt-get install openssl` for Ubuntu.  There are web pages that show how to intall it on Windows.  Once installed and the $PATH variables set up, test to see if the command works by typing:\n",
    "> `openssl version`\n",

Information in the passport shows informations such as \"issued by\", \"issued to\", and the validity period from \"issue date\" to \"expiration date\".  \n",

Imagine trying to enter a country with a passport issued from the non-existant country \"Gerschonia\".  Immigration Control will send you right back home!!!\n",

    "TLS certificates are issued in a similar manner.  Instead of being issued by a country, certificates are issued by well-known **Trusted Third Parties** known as *Certificate Authorities* (CA).   What is meant by \"well-known\"? A CA must go through rigorous checks and follow strict security procedures before it can become certified as a CA.  Web browsers maintain a list of registered CAs that they then use as roots-of-trust.    Any certificate issued by one of these CAs is considered as trustworthy by your web browser.  \n",

    "How many CAs are there on planet Earth?  There are hundreds of CAs throughout the globe.  Your web browser  keeps a list of trusted CA's  in your web browser's trust-store.  In Firefox you can view the list of trusted CAs by going to `Preferences, Security & Privacy, View Certificates`.  There are similar mechanisms in other browsers.  A sample screen-shot showing just a few of the trusted CAs in Firefox is shown below:"
